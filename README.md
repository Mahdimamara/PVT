The Python code developed in this project focuses on detecting and separating samples collected under poor conditions or analyzed non-standardly. The code incorporates a novel ranking method to evaluate the coordination of fluid samples within a region. This dataset comprises 136 fluid samples from five reservoirs in Iranian fields, each characterized by 21 key parameters. The code implements five prominent machine learning-based anomaly detection techniques to compare fluid samples and identify outliers that deviate significantly from the norm. The performance of these outlier detection methods is evaluated against a traditional gas-oil ratio estimation validation approach, showcasing an average accuracy of 79%. Moreover, the code utilizes scoring-based algorithms to identify the most representative fluid samples for each reservoir. Additionally, fuzzy logic is employed to generate a final score for each sample by synthesizing the outputs of the six methods and ranking the samples accordingly. This Python code underscores the efficacy of outlier detection techniques, machine learning, and fuzzy logic in ensuring robust fluid validation and sample ranking, outperforming traditional methods by considering all critical fluid parameters simultaneously.
